### About Me

I am an Electrical & Electronics Systems Engineer working in the automotive domain. I am curious by nature and motivated to build a strong foundational understanding of Embedded Systems as a base for the Physical AI world.

Currently, I am exploring Embedded Systems, Generative AI applications, and Physical AI topics, with the goal of applying these concepts to real-world engineering problems.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration, including creating open-source projects, working on mini projects, or learning together through hands-on experimentation.

I use GitHub to document my learning, share experiments, and grow step by step.
