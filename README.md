### About Me

I am an Electrical and Embedded Systems Engineer working in the automotive domain. I am curious by nature and motivated to build a strong foundational understanding of Embedded Systems as a base for the Physical AI world.

I believe Embedded Systems play a key role in connecting software intelligence with the physical world. My focus is on understanding systems deeply, from hardware interfaces and low-level software to system-level behavior.

I strongly believe in continuous learning and open collaboration with like-minded people. I prefer learning by building, experimenting, and sharing knowledge openly.

Currently, I am exploring Embedded Systems, Generative AI applications, and Physical AI topics, with the goal of applying these concepts to real-world engineering problems.

I use GitHub to document my learning, share experiments, and grow step by step.
